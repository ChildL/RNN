The Cat in the Hat

By Dr. Seuss

The sun did not shine.
It was too wet to play.
So we sat in the house
All that cold, cold, wet day.

I sat there with Sally.
We sat there, we two.
And I said, "How I wish
We had something to do!"

Too wet to go out
And too cold to play ball.
So we sat in the house.
We did nothing at all.

So all we could do was to

Sit!
Sit!
Sit!
Sit!

And we did not like it.
Not one little bit.

BUMP!

And then
something went BUMP!
How that bump made us jump!

We looked!
Then we saw him step in on the mat!
We looked!
And we saw him!
The Cat in the Hat!
And he said to us,
"Why do you sit there like that?"
"I know it is wet
And the sun is not sunny.
But we can have
Lots of good fun that is funny!"

"I know some good games we could play,"
Said the cat.
"I know some new tricks,"
Said the Cat in the Hat.
"A lot of good tricks.
I will show them to you.
Your mother
Will not mind at all if I do."

Then Sally and I
Did not know what to say.
Our mother was out of the house
For the day.

But our fish said, "No! No!
Make that cat go away!
Tell that Cat in the Hat
You do NOT want to play.
He should not be here.
He should not be about.
He should not be here
When your mother is out!"

"Now! Now! Have no fear.
Have no fear!" said the cat.
"My tricks are not bad,"
Said the Cat in the Hat.
"Why, we can have
Lots of good fun, if you wish,
with a game that I call
UP-UP-UP with a fish!"

"Put me down!" said the fish.
"This is no fun at all!
Put me down!" said the fish.
"I do NOT wish to fall!"

"Have no fear!" said the cat.
"I will not let you fall.
I will hold you up high
As I stand on a ball.
With a book on one hand!
And a cup on my hat!
But that is not ALL I can do!"
Said the cat...

"Look at me!
Look at me now!" said the cat.
"With a cup and a cake
On the top of my hat!
I can hold up TWO books!
I can hold up the fish!
And a litte toy ship!
And some milk on a dish!
And look!
I can hop up and down on the ball!
But that is not all!
Oh, no.
That is not all...

"Look at me!
Look at me!
Look at me NOW!
It is fun to have fun
But you have to know how.
I can hold up the cup
And the milk and the cake!
I can hold up these books!
And the fish on a rake!
I can hold the toy ship
And a little toy man!
And look! With my tail
I can hold a red fan!
I can fan with the fan
As I hop on the ball!
But that is not all.
Oh, no.
That is not all...."

That is what the cat said...
Then he fell on his head!
He came down with a bump
From up there on the ball.
And Sally and I,
We saw ALL the things fall!

And our fish came down, too.
He fell into a pot!
He said, "Do I like this?"
Oh, no! I do not.
This is not a good game,"
Said our fish as he lit.
"No, I do not like it,
Not one little bit!"

"Now look what you did!"
Said the fish to the cat.
"Now look at this house!
Look at this! Look at that!
You sank our toy ship,
Sank it deep in the cake.
You shook up our house
And you bent our new rake.
You SHOULD NOT be here
When our mother is not.
You get out of this house!"
Said the fish in the pot.

"But I like to be here.
Oh, I like it a lot!"
Said the Cat in the Hat
To the fish in the pot.
"I will NOT go away.
I do NOT wish to go!
And so," said the Cat in the Hat,

"So
so
so...

I will show you
Another good game that I know!"
And then he ran out.
And, then, fast as a fox,
The Cat in the Hat
Came back in with a box.
A big red wood box.
It was shut with a hook.
"Now look at this trick,"
Said the cat.
"Take a look!"

Then he got up on top
With a tip of his hat.
"I call this game FUN-IN-A-BOX,"
Said the cat.
"In this box are two things
I will show to you now.
You will like these two things,"
Said the cat with a bow.

"I will pick up the hook.
You will see something new.
Two things. And I call them
Thing One and Thing Two.
These Things will not bite you.
They want to have fun."
Then, out of the box
Came Thing Two and Thing One!
And they ran to us fast.
They said, "How do you do?
Would you like to shake hands
With Thing One and Thing Two?"

And Sally and I
Did not know what to do.
So we had to shake hands
With Thing One and Thing Two.
We shook their two hands.
But our fish said, "No! No!
Those Things should not be
In this house! Make them go!
"They should not be here
When your mother is not!
Put them out! Put them out!"
Said the fish in the pot.

"Have no fear, little fish,"
Said the Cat in the Hat.
"These Things are good Things."
And he gave them a pat.
"They are tame. Oh, so tame!
They have come here to play.
They will give you some fun
On this wet, wet, wet day."

"Now, here is a game that they like,"
Said the cat.
"They like to fly kites,"
Said the Cat in the Hat

"No! Not in the house!"
Said the fish in the pot.
"They should not fly kites
In a house! They should not.
Oh, the things they will bump!
Oh, the things they will hit!
Oh, I do not like it!
Not one little bit!" Then Sally and I
Saw them run down the hall.
We saw those two Things
Bump their kites on the wall!
Bump! Thump! Thump! Bump!
Down the wall in the hall.

Thing Two and Thing One!
They ran up! They ran down!
On the string of one kite
We saw Mother's new gown!
Her gown with the dots
That are pink, white and red.
Then we saw one kite bump
On the head of her bed!

Then those Things ran about
With big bumps, jumps and kicks
And with hops and big thumps
And all kinds of bad tricks.
And I said,
"I do NOT like the way that they play
If Mother could see this,
Oh, what would she say!"

Then our fish said, "Look! Look!"
And our fish shook with fear.
"Your mother is on her way home!
Do you hear?
Oh, what will she do to us?
What will she say?
Oh, she will not like it
To find us this way!"

"So, DO something! Fast!" said the fish.
"Do you hear!
I saw her. Your mother!
Your mother is near!
So, as fast as you can,
Think of something to do!
You will have to get rid of
Thing One and Thing Two!"

So, as fast as I could,
I went after my net.
And I said, "With my net
I can get them I bet.
I bet, with my net,
I can get those Things yet!"

Then I let down my net.
It came down with a PLOP!
And I had them! At last!
Thoe two Things had to stop.
Then I said to the cat,
"Now you do as I say.
You pack up those Things
And you take them away!"

"Oh dear!" said the cat,
"You did not like our game...
Oh dear.

What a shame!
What a shame!
What a shame!"

Then he shut up the Things
In the box with the hook.
And the cat went away
With a sad kind of look.

"That is good," said the fish.
"He has gone away. Yes.
But your mother will come.
She will find this big mess!
And this mess is so big
And so deep and so tall,
We ca not pick it up.
There is no way at all!"

And THEN!
Who was back in the house?
Why, the cat!
"Have no fear of this mess,"
Said the Cat in the Hat.
"I always pick up all my playthings
And so...
I will show you another
Good trick that I know!"

Then we saw him pick up
All the things that were down.
He picked up the cake,
And the rake, and the gown,
And the milk, and the strings,
And the books, and the dish,
And the fan, and the cup,
And the ship, and the fish.
And he put them away.
Then he said, "That is that."
And then he was gone
With a tip of his hat.

Then our mother came in
And she said to us two,
"Did you have any fun?
Tell me. What did you do?"

And Sally and I did not know
What to say.
Should we tell her
The things that went on there that day?

Should we tell her about it?
Now, what SHOULD we do?
Well...
What would YOU do
If your mother asked YOU?

How The Grinch Stole Christmas
by Dr. Suess

Every Who Down in Whoville Liked Christmas a lot...
But the Grinch,Who lived just north of Whoville, Did NOT!
The Grinch hated Christmas! The whole Christmas season!
Now, please don't ask why. No one quite knows the reason.
It could be his head wasn't screwed on just right.
It could be, perhaps, that his shoes were too tight.
But I think that the most likely reason of all,
May have been that his heart was two sizes too small.
Whatever the reason, His heart or his shoes,
He stood there on Christmas Eve, hating the Whos,
Staring down from his cave with a sour, Grinchy frown,
At the warm lighted windows below in their town.
For he knew every Who down in Whoville beneath,
Was busy now, hanging a mistletoe wreath.
"And they're hanging their stockings!" he snarled with a sneer,
"Tomorrow is Christmas! It's practically here!"
Then he growled, with his Grinch fingers nervously drumming,
"I MUST find some way to stop Christmas from coming!"
For Tomorrow, he knew, all the Who girls and boys,
Would wake bright and early. They'd rush for their toys!
And then! Oh, the noise! Oh, the Noise!
Noise! Noise! Noise!
That's one thing he hated! The NOISE!
NOISE! NOISE! NOISE!
Then the Whos, young and old, would sit down to a feast.
And they'd feast! And they'd feast! And they'd FEAST!
FEAST! FEAST! FEAST!
They would feast on Who-pudding, and rare Who-roast beast.
Which was something the Grinch couldn't stand in the least!
And THEN They'd do something He liked least of all!
Every Who down in Whoville, the tall and the small,
Would stand close together, with Christmas bells ringing.
They'd stand hand-in-hand. And the Whos would start singing!
They'd sing! And they'd sing! And they'd SING!
SING! SING! SING!
And the more the Grinch thought of this Who ChristmasSing,
The more the Grinch thought, "I must stop this whole thing!"
"Why, for fifty-three years I've put up with it now!"
"I MUST stop this Christmas from coming! But HOW?"
Then he got an idea! An awful idea!
THE GRINCH GOT A WONDERFUL, AWFUL IDEA!
"I know just what to do!" The Grinch laughed in his throat.
And he made a quick Santy Claus hat and a coat.
And he chuckled, and clucked, "What a great Grinchy trick!"
"With this coat and this hat, I look just like Saint Nick!"
"All I need is a reindeer..." The Grinch looked around.
But, since reindeer are scarce, there was none to be found.
Did that stop the old Grinch? No! The Grinch simply said,
"If I can't find a reindeer, I'll make one instead!"
So he called his dog, Max. Then he took some red thread,
And he tied a big horn on the top of his head.
THEN He loaded some bags And some old empty sacks,
On a ramshackle sleigh And he hitched up old Max.
Then the Grinch said, "Giddap!" And the sleigh started down,
Toward the homes where the Whos Lay asnooze in their town.
All their windows were dark. Quiet snow filled the air.
All the Whos were all dreaming sweet dreams without care.
When he came to the first little house on the square.
"This is stop number one," the old Grinchy Claus hissed,
And he climbed to the roof, empty bags in his fist.
Then he slid down the chimney. A rather tight pinch.
But, if Santa could do it, then so could the Grinch.
He got stuck only once, for a moment or two.
Then he stuck his head out of the fireplace flue.
Where the little Who stockings all hung in a row.
"These stockings," he grinned, "are the first things to go!"
Then he slithered and slunk, with a smile most unpleasant,
Around the whole room, and he took every present!
Pop guns! And bicycles! Roller skates! Drums!
Checkerboards! Tricycles! Popcorn! And plums!
And he stuffed them in bags. Then the Grinch, very nimbly,
Stuffed all the bags, one by one, up the chimney!
Then he slunk to the icebox. He took the Whos' feast!
He took the Who-pudding! He took the roast beast!
He cleaned out that icebox as quick as a flash.
Why, that Grinch even took their last can of Who-hash!
Then he stuffed all the food up the chimney with glee.
"And NOW!" grinned the Grinch, "I will stuff up the tree!"
And the Grinch grabbed the tree, and he started to shove,
When he heard a small sound like the coo of a dove.
He turned around fast, and he saw a small Who!
Little Cindy-Lou Who, who was not more than two.
The Grinch had been caught by this tiny Who daughter,
Who'd got out of bed for a cup of cold water.
She stared at the Grinch and said, "Santy Claus, why,î
"Why are you taking our Christmas tree? WHY?"
But, you know, that old Grinch was so smart and so slick,
He thought up a lie, and he thought it up quick!
"Why, my sweet little tot," the fake Santy Claus lied,
"There's a light on this tree that won't light on one side."
"So I'm taking it home to my workshop, my dear."
"I'll fix it up there. Then I'll bring it back here."
And his fib fooled the child. Then he patted her head,
And he got her a drink and he sent her to bed.
And when CindyLou Who went to bed with her cup,
HE went to the chimney and stuffed the tree up!
Then the last thing he took Was the log for their fire!
Then he went up the chimney, himself, the old liar.
On their walls he left nothing but hooks and some wire.
And the one speck of food That he left in the house,
Was a crumb that was even too small for a mouse.
Then He did the same thing To the other Whos' houses
Leaving crumbs Much too small For the other Whos' mouses!
It was quarter past dawn... All the Whos, still a-bed,
All the Whos, still asnooze When he packed up his sled,
Packed it up with their presents! The ribbons! The wrappings!
The tags! And the tinsel! The trimmings! The trappings!
Three thousand feet up! Up the side of Mt. Crumpit,
He rode with his load to the tiptop to dump it!
"PoohPooh to the Whos!" he was grinchishly humming.
"They're finding out now that no Christmas is coming!"
"They're just waking up! I know just what they'll do!"
"Their mouths will hang open a minute or two,
Then the Whos down in Whoville will all cry BooHoo!"
"That's a noise," grinned the Grinch, "That I simply MUST hear!"
So he paused. And the Grinch put his hand to his ear.
And he did hear a sound rising over the snow.
It started in low. Then it started to grow.
But the sound wasn't sad! Why, this sound sounded merry!
It couldn't be so! But it WAS merry! VERY!
He stared down at Whoville! The Grinch popped his eyes!
Then he shook! What he saw was a shocking surprise!
Every Who down in Whoville, the tall and the small,
Was singing! Without any presents at all!
He HADN'T stopped Christmas from coming! IT CAME!
Somehow or other, it came just the same!
And the Grinch, with his grinch-feet ice-cold in the snow,
Stood puzzling and puzzling: "How could it be so?"
"It came with out ribbons! It came without tags!"
"It came without packages, boxes or bags!"
And he puzzled three hours, till his puzzler was sore.
Then the Grinch thought of something he hadn't before!
"Maybe Christmas," he thought, "doesn't come from a store."
"Maybe Christmas...perhaps...means a little bit more!"
And what happened then? Well...in Whoville they say,
That the Grinch's small heart Grew three sizes that day!
And the minute his heart didn't feel quite so tight,
He whizzed with his load through the bright morning light,
And he brought back the toys! And the food for the feast!
And he, HE HIMSELF! The Grinch carved the roast beast!

Ask me tomorrow but not today.
ÔªøOn the 15th of May, in the Jungle of Nool, In the heat of the day, in the cool of the pool, He
was splashing‚Ä¶ enjoying the jungle‚Äôs great joys‚Ä¶ When Horton the elephant heard a small
noise.
So Horton stopped splashing. He looked toward the sound. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs funny,‚Äù thought Horton.
‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no one around.‚Äù Then he heard it again! Just a very faint yelp as if some tiny
person were calling for help. "I‚Äôll help you," said Horton. ‚ÄúBut who are you? Where?‚Äù He
looked and he looked. He could see nothing there but a small speck of dust blowing past
through the air.
‚ÄúI say!‚Äù murmured Horton. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve never heard tell of a small speck of dust that is able to yell.
So you know what I think?... Why, I think that there must be someone on top of that small
speck of dust! Some sort of a creature of very small size, too small to be seen by an
elephant‚Äôs eyes‚Ä¶
‚Äú‚Ä¶ some poor little person who‚Äôs shaking with fear that he‚Äôll blow in the pool! He has no
way to steer! I‚Äôll just have to save him. Because, after all, a person‚Äôs a person, no matter how
small.‚Äù
So, gently, and using the greatest of care, the elephant stretched his great trunk through the
air, and he lifted the dust speck and carried it over and placed it down, safe, on a very soft
clover.
‚ÄúHumpf!‚Äù humpfted a voice. ‚ÄòTwas a sour kangaroo. And the you kangaroo in her pouch said
‚ÄúHumpf‚Äù too. ‚Äú Why, that speck is as small as the head of a pin. A person on that?... Why,
there never has been!‚Äù
‚ÄúBelieve me,‚Äù said Horton. ‚ÄúI tell you sincerely, my ears are quite keen and I heard him quite
clearly. I know there‚Äôs a person down there. And, what‚Äôs more, quite likely there‚Äôs two.
Even three. Even four. Quite likely‚Ä¶
‚Äú‚Ä¶a family, for all that we know! A family with children just starting to grow. So, please,‚Äù
Horton said, ‚Äúas a favor to me, try not to disturb them. Just please let them be.‚Äù
‚ÄúI think you‚Äôre a fool!‚Äù laughed the sour kangaroo and the young kangaroo in her pouch
said, ‚ÄúMe, too! You‚Äôre the biggest blame fool in the Jungle of Nool!‚Äù And the kangaroos
plunged in the cool of the pool. ‚ÄúWhat terrible splashing!‚Äù the elephant frowned. ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt let
my very small person get drowned!‚Äù I‚Äôve got to protect them. I‚Äôm bigger than they.‚Äù So he
plucked up the clover and hustled away.
Through the high jungle tree tops, the news quickly spread: ‚ÄúHe talks to a dust speck! He‚Äôs
out of his head! Just look at him walk with that speck on that flower!‚Äù And Horton walked,
worrying, almost an hour. ‚ÄúShould I put this speck down?...‚Äù Horton thought with alarm. ‚ÄúIf 
I do, these small persons may come to great harm. I can‚Äôt put it down. And I won‚Äôt! After all
a person‚Äôs a person. No matter how small.‚Äù
Then Horton stopped walking. The speck-voice was talking! The voice was so faint he could
just barley hear it. ‚ÄúSpeak up, please‚Äù said Horton. He put his ear near it. ‚ÄúMy friend,‚Äù came
the voice, ‚Äúyou‚Äôre a very fine friend. You‚Äôve helped all us folks on this dust speck no end.
You‚Äôve saved all our houses, our ceilings and floors. You‚Äôve saved all our churches and
grocery stores.‚Äù
‚ÄúYou mean‚Ä¶‚Äù Horton gasped, ‚Äúyou have buildings there, too?‚Äù ‚ÄúOh, yes,‚Äù piped the voice.
‚ÄúWe most certainly do‚Ä¶ ‚ÄúI know,‚Äù called the voice, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm too small to be seen but I‚Äôm mayor
of a town that is friendly and clean. Our buildings, to you, would seem terribly small but to
us, who aren‚Äôt big, they are wonderfully tall. My town is called Who-ville, for I am a Who
and we Whos are all thankful and grateful to you.‚Äù And Horton called back to the Mayor of
the town, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre safe now. Don‚Äôt worry. I won‚Äôt let you down.‚Äù
But, just as he spoke to the mayor of the speck, three big jungle monkeys climbed up
Horton‚Äôs neck! The Wickersham Brothers came shouting, ‚ÄúWhat rot! This elephant‚Äôs talking
to Whos who are not! There aren‚Äôt any Whos! And they don‚Äôt have a mayor! And we‚Äôre
going to stop all the nonsense! So there!‚Äù
They snatched Horton‚Äôs clover! They carried it off to a black-bottomed eagle named Vlad
Vlad-i-koff, a mighty strong eagle, of very swift wing, and they said, ‚ÄúWill you kindly get rid
of this thing?‚Äù And, before the poor elephant even could speak, that eagle flew off with the
flower in his beak.
All that latte afternoon and far into the night that black-bottomed bird flapped his wings in
fast flight, while Horton chased after, with groans, over stones that tattered his toenails and
battered his bones, and begged, ‚ÄúPlease don‚Äôt harm all my little folks, who have as much
right to live as us bigger folks do!‚Äù But far, far beyond him, that eagle kept flapping and over
his shoulder called back, ‚ÄúQuit your yapping. I‚Äôll fly the night through. I‚Äôm a bird. I don‚Äôt
mind it. And I‚Äôll hide this, tomorrow, where you‚Äôll never find it!‚Äù
And at 6:56 the next morning he did it. It sure was a terrible place that he hid it. He let that
small clover drop somewhere inside of a great patch of clovers a hundred miles wide! ‚ÄúFind
THAT!‚Äù sneered the bird. ‚ÄúBut I think you will fail.‚Äù And he left with a flip of his blackbottomed
tail.
‚ÄúI‚Äôll find it!‚Äù cried Horton. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll find it or bust! I SHALL find my friends on my small speck of
dust!‚Äù And clover, by clover, by clover with care he picked up and searched them, and
called, ‚ÄúAre you there?‚Äù But clover, by clover, by clover he found that the one that he sough
for was just not around. And by noon poor old Horton, more dead than alive, had picked,
searched, and piled up, nine thousand and five. 
Then, on through the afternoon, hour after hour‚Ä¶ till he found them at last! On the three
millionth flower! ‚ÄúMy friends!‚Äù cried the elephant. ‚ÄúTell me! Do tell! Are you safe? Are you
sound? Are you whole? Are you well?‚Äù
From down on the speck came the voice of the mayor: ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve really had trouble! Much
more that our share. When that black-bottomed birdie let go and we dropped, we landed so
hard that our clocks have all stopped. Our tea-pots are broken. Our rocking-chairs smashed.
And our bicycle tired all blew up when we crashed. So, Horton, please!‚Äù pleaded that voice
of the mayor‚Äôs, ‚ÄúWill you stick by us Whos while we‚Äôre making repairs?‚Äù ‚ÄúOf course,‚Äù Horton
answered. ‚ÄúOf course I will stick. I‚Äôll stick by you small folks through thin and through
thick!‚Äù
‚ÄúHumpf!‚Äù Humpfed a voice! ‚ÄúFor almost two days you‚Äôve run wild and insisted on chatting
with persons who‚Äôve never existed. Such carryings-on in our peaceable jungle! We‚Äôve had
quite enough of your bellowing bungle! And I‚Äôm here to state,‚Äù snapped the big kangaroo,
‚Äúthat your silly nonsensical game is all through!‚Äù And the young kangaroo in her pouch said,
‚ÄúMe, too!‚Äù
‚ÄúWith the help of the Wickersham Brothers and dozens of Wickersham uncles and
Wickersham cousins and Wickersham in-laws, whose help I‚Äôve engaged, you‚Äôre going to be
roped! And you‚Äôre going to be caged! And, as for our dust speck‚Ä¶hah! That we shall boil in
hot steaming kettle of beezle-nut oil!‚Äù ‚ÄúBoil it?...‚Äù gasped Horton! ‚ÄúOh, that you can‚Äôt do! It‚Äôs
all full of persons! They‚Äôll prove it to you!‚Äù
‚ÄúMr. Mayor! Mr. Mayor!‚Äù Horton called. ‚ÄúMr. Mayor! You‚Äôve got to prove now that you really
are there! So call a big meeting. Get everyone out. Make every Who holler! Make every Who
shout! Make every Who scream! If you don‚Äôt, every Who is going to end up in a beezle-nut
stew!‚Äù
And, down on the dust speck, the scared little mayor quick called a big meeting in Who-ville
Town Square. And his people cried loudly. They cried out in fear: ‚ÄúWe are here! We are
here! We are here! We are here!‚Äù
The elephant smiled: ‚ÄúThat was clear as a bell. You kangaroos surely heard that very well.‚Äù
‚ÄúAll I heard,‚Äù snapped the big kangaroo, ‚Äúwas the breeze, and the faint sound of wind
through the far distant trees. I heard no small voices. And you didn‚Äôt either.‚Äù And the young
kangaroo in her pouch said, ‚ÄúMe, neither.‚Äù
‚ÄúGrab him!‚Äù they shouted. ‚ÄúAnd cage the big dope! Lasso his stomach with ten miles of rope!
Tie the knots tight so he‚Äôll never shake loose! Then dunk that dumb speck in the beezle-nut
juice!‚Äù
Horton fought back with great vigor and vim but the Wickersham gang was too many for
him. They beat him! They mauled him! They started to haul him into his cage! But he
managed to call to the mayor: ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt give up! I believe in you all! A person‚Äôs a person, no 
matter how small! And you very small persons will not have to die if you make yourselves
heard! So come on, now, and TRY!‚Äù
The mayor grabbed a tom-tom. He started to smack it. And, all over Who-ville, they
whooped up a racket. They rattled tin kettles! They beat on brass pans, on garbage pail tops
and old cranberry cans! They blew on bazookas and blasted great toots on clarinets, oompahs
and boom-pahs and flutes!
Great gusts of loud racket rang high through the air. They rattled and shook the whole sky!
And the mayor called up through the howling mad hullabaloo: ‚ÄúHey, Horton! How‚Äôs this? Is
our sound coming through?‚Äù
And Horton called back, ‚ÄúI can hear you fine. But the kangaroos‚Äô ears aren‚Äôt as strong, quite,
as mine. They don‚Äôt hear a thing! Are you sure all your boys are doing their best? Are they
ALL making noise? Are you sure every Who down in Who-ville is working? Quick! Look
through your town! Is there anyone shirking?‚Äù
Through the town rushed the mayor from the east to the west. But everyone seemed to be
doing his best. Everyone seemed to be yapping or yipping! Everyone seemed to be beeping
or bipping! But it wasn‚Äôt enough, all this ruckus and roar! He HAD to find someone to help
him make more. He raced through each building! He searched floor-to-floor!
And, just as he felt he as getting nowhere, and almost about to give up in despair, He
suddenly burst through a door and that mayor discovered on shirker! Quite hidden away in
the Fairfax Apartments (Apartment 12-J) a very small, very small shirker named Jo-Jo was
standing, and bouncing a Yo-Yo! Not making a sound! Not a yipp! Not a chirp! And the
mayor rushed inside and he greabbed the young twerp!
And he climbed with the lad up the Eiffelberg Tower. ‚ÄúThis,‚Äù cried the mayor, ‚Äúis your
town‚Äôs darkest hour! The time for all Whos who have blood that is red to come to the aid of
their country!‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve GOT to make noises in greater amounts! So, open your
mouth, lad! For every voice counts!‚Äù Thus he spoke as he climbed. When they got to the top,
the lad cleared his throat and he shouted out, ‚ÄúYopp!‚Äù
And that Yopp‚Ä¶ That one small extra Yopp put it over! Finally, at last! From that speck on
that clover their voices were heard! They rang out clear and clean. And the elephant smiled.
‚ÄúDo you see what I mean?... They‚Äôve proved they ARE persons, not matter how small. And
their whole world was saved by the Smallest of ALL!‚Äù ‚ÄúHow true! Yes, how true,‚Äù said the
big kangaroo. ‚ÄúAnd, from now on, you know what I‚Äôm planning to do?... From now on, I‚Äôm
going to protect them with you!‚Äù And the young kangaroo in her pouch said,‚Ä¶
‚Äú‚Ä¶ME, TOO! From sun in the summer. From rain when it‚Äôs fall-ish, I‚Äôm going to protect
them. No matter how small-ish!I can read in red.
I can read in blue.
I can read in pickle-color too.

I can read in bed.
And in purple.
And in brown.
I can read in a circle and upside-down!

I can read with my left eye.
I can read with my right.
I can read Mississippi with my eyes shut tight!

Mississippi,
Indianapolis,
and
Hallelujah,
too!
I can read them
with my eyes shut!
That is
VERY HARD
to do!

But it's bad
for my hat
and makes
my eyebrows
get red hot.
SO...
reading with
my eyes shut
I don't do an awful lot.

And when I keep them open
I can read with much more speed.
You have to be a speedy reader
'cause there's so, so much to read!

You can read about trees...
and bees...
and knees.
And knees on trees!
And bees on threes!

You can read about anchors.
And all about ants.
You can read
about ankles!
And crocodile pants!

You can read about hoses...
and how to smell roses...
and what
you should do
about owls on noses!

Young cat! If you keep
your eyes open enough,
oh, the stuff you will learn!
The most wonderful stuff!
You'll learn about...
fishbones...
and wishbones.
You'll learn
about trombones,
too.
You'll learn
about Jake
the Pillow Snake
and all about
Foo-Foo the Snoo.

You can learn about ice.
You can learn about mice.
Mice on ice.
And ice on mice.
You can learn about
the price of ice.
Nice ice
for sale.
Ten cents a pail.

You can learn about SAD...
and GLAD...
and MAD!
There are 
so many things
you can learn about.
BUT...
you'll miss
the best things
if you keep
your eyes shut.

The more that you read,
the more things you will know.
The more that you learn,
the more places you'll go.

You might learn
a way to earn
a few dollars.
Or how to make doughnuts...
or kangaroo collars.

You can learn to read music
and play a Hut-Zut
if you keep your eyes open.
But not with them shut.

If you read with your eyes shut
you're likely to find
that the place where you're going
is far, far behind

SO...
that's why I tell you
to keep your eyes wide.
Keep them wide open...
at least on one side."Come inside, Mr. Bird,"
Said the mouse.
"I'll show you what there is
In the People House...

A People House has things like...
...chairs
Things like roller skates
And stairs

Banana bathtub bottles brooms
That's what you find in people's rooms
Scissors needle buttons thread
Cup and saucer pillow bed

These are doughnuts.
Here's a door
Come along, I'll show you more.
Here's a ceiling here's a floor.

Piano peanuts popcorn pails
Pencil paper hammer nails
Salt and pepper goldfish key
Table telephone TV
Come on! Come on! There's more to see!

You'll see a kitchen sink 
In a People House.
A shoe and a sock and a clock said the mouse

Bread and butter window wall
Toothbrush hairbrush big blue ball
Baked beans bureau drawers and books
Lights and lamps and hats and hooks

Mirror marbles shirt and string
Knife fork spoon and bells to ring
Doll and dishes teapot trash
Look out below! I'm going to crash

And... Another thing it's time you knew...
... A People House has people, too!

"And now, Mr. Bird, you know."
Said the mouse.
"You know what there is in a People House."

The time has come.

The time has come.
The time is now.

Just go. Go. GO!
I don't care how.

You can go by foot.
You can go by cow.

Mr. Brown can do it.
How about you?Congratulations!
Today is your day.
You're off to Great Places!
You're off and away!

You have brains in your head.
You have feet in your shoes.
You can steer yourself 
any direction you choose.
You're on your own. And you know what you know.
And YOU are the guy who'll decide where to go.

You'll look up and down streets. Look 'em over with care.
About some you will say, "I don't choose to go there."
With your head full of brains and your shoes full of feet, 
you're too smart to go down any not-so-good street.

And you may not find any
you'll want to go down.
In that case, of course,
you'll head straight out of town.

It's opener there
in the wide open air.

Out there things can happen
and frequently do
to people as brainy
and footsy as you.

And then things start to happen,
don't worry. Don't stew.
Just go right along.
You'll start happening too.

OH!
THE PLACES YOU'LL GO!

You'll be on y our way up!
You'll be seeing great sights!
You'll join the high fliers
who soar to high heights.

You won't lag behind, because you'll have the speed.
You'll pass the whole gang and you'll soon take the lead.
Wherever you fly, you'll be best of the best.
Wherever you go, you will top all the rest.

Except when you don't.
Because, sometimes, you won't.

I'm sorry to say so
but, sadly, it's true
that Bang-ups
and Hang-ups
can happen to you.

You can get all hung up
in a prickle-ly perch.
And your gang will fly on.
You'll be left in a Lurch.

You'll come down from the Lurch
with an unpleasant bump.
And the chances are, then,
that you'll be in a Slump.

And when you're in a Slump,
you're not in for much fun.
Un-slumping yourself
is not easily done.

You will come to a place where the streets are not marked.
Some windows are lighted. But mostly they're darked.
A place you could sprain both your elbow and chin!
Do you dare to stay out? Do you dare to go in?
How much can you lose? How much can you win?

And IF you go in, should you turn left or right...
or right-and-three-quarters? Or, maybe, not quite?
Or go around back and sneak in from behind?
Simple it's not, I'm afraid you will find,
for a mind-maker-upper to make up his mind.

You can get so confused
that you'll start in to race
down long wiggled roads at a break-necking pace
and grind on for miles cross weirdish wild space,
headed, I fear, toward a most useless place.
The Waiting Place...

...for people just waiting.
Waiting for a train to go
or a bus to come, or a plane to go
or the mail to come, or the rain to go
or the phone to ring, or the snow to snow
or the waiting around for a Yes or No
or waiting for their hair to grow.
Everyone is just waiting.

Waiting for the fish to bite
or waiting for the wind to fly a kite
or waiting around for Friday night
or waiting, perhaps, for their Uncle Jake
or a pot to boil, or a Better Break
or a string of pearls, or a pair of pants
or a wig with curls, or Another Chance.
Everyone is just waiting.

NO!
That's not for you!

Somehow you'll escape
all that waiting and staying
You'll find the bright places
where Boom Bands are playing.

With banner flip-flapping,
once more you'll ride high!
Ready for anything under the sky.
Ready because you're that kind of a guy!

Oh, the places you'll go! There is fun to be done!
There are points to be scored. There are games to be won.
And the magical things you can do with that ball
will make you the winning-est winner of all.
Fame! You'll be as famous as famous can be,
with the whole wide world watching you win on TV.

Except when they don't
Because, sometimes they won't.

I'm afraid that some times
you'll play lonely games too.
Games you can't win
'cause you'll play against you.

All Alone!
Whether you like it or not,
Alone will be something
you'll be quite a lot.

And when you're alone, there's a very good chance
you'll meet things that scare you right out of your pants.
There are some, down the road between hither and yon,
that can scare you so much you won't want to go on.

But on you will go
though the weather be foul.
On you will go
though your enemies prowl.
On you will go
though the Hakken-Kraks howl.
Onward up many
a frightening creek,
though your arms may get sore
and your sneakers may leak.

On and on you will hike,
And I know you'll hike far
and face up to your problems
whatever they are.

You'll get mixed up, of course,
as you already know.
You'll get mixed up 
with many strange birds as you go.
So be sure when you step.
Step with care and great tact
and remember that Life's 
a Great Balancing Act.
Just never foget to be dexterous and deft.
And never mix up your right foot with your left.

And will you succeed?
Yes! You will, indeed!
(98 and 3/4 percent guaranteed.)

KID, YOU'LL MOVE MOUNTAINS!

So...
be your name Buxbaum or Bixby or Bray
or Mordecai Ali Van Allen O'Shea,
You're off the Great Places!
Today is your day!
Your mountain is waiting.
So...get on your way!One fish, Two fish, Red fish, Blue fish,
Black fish, Blue fish, Old fish, New fish.
This one has a littlecar.
This one has a little star.
Say! What a lot of fish there are.
Yes. Some are red, and some are blue.
Some are old and some are new.
Some are sad, and some are glad,
And some are very, very bad.
Why are they sad and glad and bad?
I do not know, go ask your dad.
Some are thin, and some are fat.
The fat one has a yellow hat.
From there to here,
From here to there,
Funny things are everywhere.
Here are some who like to run.
They run for fun in the hot, hot sun.
Oh me! Oh my! Oh me! oh my!
What a lot of funny things go by.
Some have two feet and some have four.
Some have six feet and some have more.
Where do they come from? I can't say.
But I bet they have come a long, long way.
we see them come, we see them go.
Some are fast. Some are slow.
Some are high. Some are low.
Not one of them is like another.
Don't ask us why, go ask your mother.

Say! Look at his fingers!
One, two, three...
How many fingers do I see?
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.
He has eleven!
Eleven! This is something new.
I wish I had eleven too!

Bump! Bump! Bump!
Did you ever ride a Wump?
We have a Wump with just one hump.
But we know a man called Mr. Gump.
Mr. gump has a seven hump Wump. So...
If you like to go Bump! Bump!
Just jump on the hump of the Wump of Gump

Who am I? My name is Ned
I do not like my little bed.
This is no good. This is not right.
My feet stick out of bed all night.
And when I pull them in, Oh, Dear!
My head sticks out of bed up here!

We like our bike. It is made for three.
Our Mike sits up in back, you see.
We like our Mike, and this is why:
Mike does all the work when the hills get high.

Hello there, Ned. How do you do?
Tell me, tell me what is new?
How are things in your little bed?
What is new? Please tell me Ned.
I do not like this bed at all.
a lot of things have come to call.
A cow, a dog, a cat, a mouse.
Oh! What a bed! Oh! What a house!

Oh dear, oh dear! I cannot hear.
Will you please come over near?
Will you please look in my ear?
There must be something there, I fear.
Say look! A bird was in your ear.
But he is out. So have no fear.
Again your ear can hear, my dear.

My hat is old, my teeth are gold.
I have a bird I like to hold.
My shoe is off, my foot is cold.
My shoe is off, my foot is cold.
I have a bird I like to hold.
My hat is old, my teeth are gold.
And now my story is all told.

We took a look. We saw a Nook.
On his head he had a hook.
On his hook he had a book.
On his book was "How to Cook"
We saw him sit and try to cook
But a Nook can't read, so a Nook can't Cook.
SO...
What good to a Nook is a hook cook book?

the moon was out and we saw some sheep.
We saw some sheep take a walk in their sleep.
by the light of the moon, by the light of a star;
They walked all night from near to far.
I would never walk. I would take a car.

I do not like this one so well.
all he does is yell, yell, yell.
I will not have this one about.
When he comes in I put him out.
This one is quiet as a mouse.
I like to have him in the house.

At our house we open cans.
We have to open many cans.
and that is why we have a Zans.
A Zans for cans is very good.
Have you a Zans for cans? You should.

I like to box. How I like to box.
So every day I box a Gox.
In yellow socks I box my Gox.
I box in yellow Gox box socks.

It is fun to sing if you sing with a Ying.
My Ying can sing like anything.
I sing high and my Ying sings low.
And we are not too bad, you know.

this one, I think, is called a Yink.
he likes to wink, he likes to drink.
He likes to drink, and drink, and drink.
the thing he likes to drink is ink.
The ink he likes to drink is pink.
He likes to wink and drink pink ink.
SO...
If you have a lot of ink,
you should get a Yink, I think.

Hop, hop, hop! I am a Yop
All I like to do is hop,
From finger top to finger top.
I hop from left to right and then...
Hop, hop! I hop right back again.
I like to hop all day and night.
From right to left and left to right.
Why do I like to hop, hop, hop?
I do not know. Go ask your Pop.

Brush, brush, brush, brush
Comb, comb, comb, comb
Blue hair is fun to brush and comb.
All girls who like to brush and comb,
Should have a pet like this at home.

Who is this pet? Say! He is wet.
You never yet met a pet, I bet,
As wet as they let this wet pet get.

Did you ever fly a kite in bed?
did you ever walk with ten cats on your head?
Did you ever milk this kind of cow?
Well, we can do it. We know how.
If you never did, you should.
These things are fun, and fun is good.

Hello, hello. Are you there?
Hello! I called you up to say hello.
I said Hello.
Can you hear me, Joe?
Oh no, I cannot hear your call.
I cannot hear your call at all.
This is not good, and I know why.
A mouse has cut the wire, goodbye!

From near to far, from here to there,
Funny things are everywhere.
These yellow pets are called the Zeds.
They have one hair upon their heads.
Their hair grows fast. So fast they say,
They need a haircut every day.

Who am I? My name is Ish
On my hand I have a dish.
I have this dish to help me wish.
When I wish to make a wish
I wave my hand with a big swish swish.
Then I say, "I wish for fish!"
And I get fish right on my dish.
So...
If you wish to make a wish,
you may swish for fish with my Ish wish dish.

At our house we play out back.
We play a game called ring the Gack.
Would you like to play this game?
Come down! We have the only Gack in town.

Look what we found in the park in the dark.
We will take him home, we will call him Clark.
He will live at our house, he will grow and grow.
Will our mother like this? We don't know.

And now, Good night.
It is time to sleep
So we will sleep with our pet Zeep.
Today is gone. Today was fun.
Tomorrow is another one.
Every day, from here to there.
funny things are everywhere.One fish, Two fish, Red fish, Blue fish,
Black fish, Blue fish, Old fish, New fish.
This one has a littlecar.
This one has a little star.
Say! What a lot of fish there are.
Yes. Some are red, and some are blue.
Some are old and some are new.
Some are sad, and some are glad,
And some are very, very bad.
Why are they sad and glad and bad?
I do not know, go ask your dad.
Some are thin, and some are fat.
The fat one has a yellow hat.
From there to here,
From here to there,
Funny things are everywhere.
Here are some who like to run.
They run for fun in the hot, hot sun.
Oh me! Oh my! Oh me! oh my!
What a lot of funny things go by.
Some have two feet and some have four.
Some have six feet and some have more.
Where do they come from? I can't say.
But I bet they have come a long, long way.
we see them come, we see them go.
Some are fast. Some are slow.
Some are high. Some are low.
Not one of them is like another.
Don't ask us why, go ask your mother.

Say! Look at his fingers!
One, two, three...
How many fingers do I see?
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.
He has eleven!
Eleven! This is something new.
I wish I had eleven too!

One apple up on top!

Two apples up on top!

Look, you.
I can do it, too.

Look!
See!
I can do three!

You can do three,
But I can do more.
You have three, but I have four.

Look! 
See, now.
I can hop with four apples up on top.

And I can hop up on a tree with four apples up on me.

Look here, you two.
See here, you two.
I can get five on top.
Can you?

I am so good I will not stop.
Five!
Now six!
Now seven on top!

Seven apples up on top!
I am so good they will not drop.

Five, six, seven!
Fun, fun, fun!
Seven, six, five, four, three, two, one!

But, see!
We are as good as you.
Look! Now we have seven, too.

And now see here.
Eight! Eight on top!
Eight apples up!
Not one will drop.

But I can do nine. 
And hop!
And drink!
You can not do this, I think.Now, the Star-Belly Sneetches-

Had bellies with stars.

The Plain-Belly Sneetches-Had none upon thars.  

Those stars weren‚Äôt so big. They were really so small.

You might think such a thing wouldn‚Äôt matter at all. 

But, because they had stars, all the Star-Belly Sneetches

Would brag, ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre the best kind of Sneetch on the beaches.

With their snoots in the air, they would sniff and they‚Äôd snort

‚ÄúWe‚Äôll have nothing to do with the Plain-Belly sort!‚Äù

And whenever they met some, when they were out walking,

They‚Äôd hike right on past them without even talking.  

When the Star-Belly children went out to play ball,

Could a Plain- Belly get in the game‚Ä¶? Not at all.

You only could play if your bellies had stars

And the Plain-Belly children had none upon thars. 

When the Star-Belly Sneetches had frankfurter roasts

Or picnics or parties or marshmallow toasts,

They never invited the Plain-Belly Sneetches.

They left them out cold, in the dark of the beaches.

They kept them away. Never let them come near.

And that‚Äôs how they treated them year after year. 

Then ONE day, seems‚Ä¶while the Plain-Belly Sneetches

Were moping and doping alone on the beaches,

Just sitting there wishing their bellies had stars‚Ä¶

A stranger zipped up in the strangest of cars! 

 

‚ÄúMy friends,‚Äù he announced in a voice clear and keen,

‚ÄúMy name is Sylvester McMonkey McBean.

And I‚Äôve heard of your troubles. I‚Äôve heard you‚Äôre unhappy.

But I can fix that. I‚Äôm the Fix-it-Up Chappie.

I‚Äôve come here to help you. I have what you need.

And my prices are low. And I work at great speed.

And my work is one hundred per cent guaranteed! 

 

Then, quickly Sylvester McMonkey McBean

Put together a very peculiar machine.

And he said, ‚ÄúYou want stars like a Star-Belly Sneetch‚Ä¶?

My friends, you can have them for three dollars each!‚Äù 

‚ÄúJust pay me your money and hop right aboard!‚Äù

So they clambered inside. Then the big machine roared

And it klonked. And it bonked. And it jerked. And it berked

And it bopped them about. But the thing really worked!

When the Plain-Belly Sneetches popped out, they had stars!

They actually did. They had stars upon thars! 

Then they yelled at the ones who had stars at the start,

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre exactly like you! You can‚Äôt tell us apart.

We‚Äôre all just the same, now, you snooty old smarties!

And now we can go to your frankfurter parties.‚Äù 

‚ÄúGood grief!‚Äù groaned the ones who had stars at the first.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre still the best Sneetches and they are the worst.

But, now, how in the world will we know,‚Äù they all frowned,

‚ÄúIf which kind is what, or the other way round?‚Äù 

Then came  McBean with a very sly wink.

And he said, ‚ÄúThings are not quite as bad as you think.

So you don‚Äôt know who‚Äôs who. That is perfectly true.

But come with me, friends. Do you know what I‚Äôll do?

I‚Äôll make you, again, the best Sneetches on beaches

And all it will cost you is ten dollars eaches.‚Äù 

‚ÄúBelly stars are no longer in style,‚Äù said McBean.

‚ÄúWhat you need is a trip through my Star-off Machine.

This wondrous contraption will take off your stars

So you won‚Äôt look like Sneetches who have them on thars.‚Äù

And that handy machine Working very precisely

Removed all the stars from their tummies quite nicely. 

Then, with snoots in the air, they paraded about

And they opened their beaks and they let out a shout,

‚ÄúWe know who is who! Now there isn‚Äôt a doubt.

The best kind of Sneetches are Sneetches without!‚Äù 

Then, of course, those with stars all got frightfully mad.

To be wearing a star now was frightfully bad.

Then, of course, old Sylvester McMonkey McBean

Invited them into his star-off machine. 

Then, of course from THEN on, as you probably guess,

Things really got into a horrible mess.

All the rest of that day, on those wild screaming beaches,

The fix-it-up Chappie kept fixing up Sneetches.

Off again! On Again!  In again! Out again!

Through the machines they raced round and about again,

Changing their stars every minute or two.

They kept paying money. They kept running through

Until neither the Plain nor the Star-Bellies knew

Whether this one was that one‚Ä¶or that one was this one

Or which one was what one ‚Ä¶or what one was who. 

Then, when every last cent

Of their money was spent,

The Fix-it-Up Chappie packed up

And he went. 

And he laughed as he drove

In his car up the beach,

‚ÄúThey never will learn.

No. You can‚Äôt teach a Sneetch!‚Äù 

But McBean was quite wrong. I‚Äôm quite happy to say

That the Sneetches got really quite smart on that day,

The day they decided that Sneetches are Sneetches

And no kind of Sneetch is the best on the beaches

That day, all the Sneetches forgot about stars

And whether they had one, or not, upon thars.It all began
With that shoe on the wall.
A shoe on a wall...?
Shouldn't be there at all!

Then I looked up.
And I sad "Oh, MAN!"
And that's how Wacky Wednesday Began.

I looked out the window.
And I said, "GEE!"
More things were wacky!
And I saw three.

I went down the hall
And I said "HEY!"
Three more things were wacky today!

In the bathroom, MORE!
In the bathroom, FOUR!

I began to dress.
Then I said, "WOW!"
Four MORE things were wacky now!

I looked in the kitchen.
I said "By cracky!
Five more things 
Are very wacky!"

I was late for school.
I started along.
And I saw that 
Six more things were wrong.

And then seven more!

And the Sutherland sisters!
They looked wacky, too.
They said "Nothing is wacky around here but you!"

"But look!" I yelled.
"Eight things are wrong here at school."
"Nothing is wrong." They said
"Don't be a fool."

I ran into school
I yelled to Miss Bass...
... "Look! Nine things are wacky
Right here in your class!"

"Nothing is wacky here in my class!
Get out! You're the wacky one! OUT!"
Said Miss Bass.

I went out the school door.
Things were worse than before.
I couldn't believe it.
Ten wacky things more!

Then I counted ELEVEN!
Then... twelve WORSE things!
I got scared and I ran.
I ran and knocked over Patrolman McGann.

"I'm sorry, Patrolman." 
That's all I could say.
"Don't be sorry," he smiled.
"It's that kind of a day.
But be glad! Wacky Wednesday will soon go away!"

"Only twenty things more will be wacky," he said.
"Just find them and then you can go back to bed."

Wacky Wednesday was gone when I counted them all.
And I even got rid of that shoe on the wall.
